passing.  Even if I failed this subject I would not need to  
repeat.  However I liked this subject very much and my results  
were bad because of my lazyness.  If I was forced to change to a  
minor in this subject I would be very unwilling.",
anger,"In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not  
like.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation  
was like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt  
that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me "" A failure, You lost  
5 marks.""   I was very angry, not because my marks were lower  
than his, but because I could not tolerate his pride.  I did not  
show my discontentment and carried on doing my work.",
fear,"This issue worried me rather than saddening me.  In mid September  
I went to Guanggho alone.  I was looking for an accomodation in  
the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not  
find anything.  What could I do?  I was not worried about  
sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems.   
I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock.",
anger,"My roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had  
melody but had no content.  We lived together so when he played  
the recorder I was forced to listen to them.  I could not tell  
him that I did not like to listen to the songs, as I had no right  
to disturb the freedom of others.  So I would find a pretext to  
leave the room and go somewhere else.",
shame,"Last Summer I went camping with some C.U students.  As I was  
working then, I had to leave the second night (some of them had  
joined us the first night).  Next morning, 6 o'clock, a female  
classmate knocked on our door and tried to wake us up.  I was not  
fully conscious and I said something which I should not have.  I  
realized the trouble I had made and wanted to hide.  Later I  
said sorry to her and the matter came to an end.",
shame,I lied to one of my best friends.,
joy,I received a letter from a distant friend.,
fear,"My parents were out and I was the eldest at home.  At midnight a  
male stranger phoned us and spoke to me in a rough language.  I  
hung up and heard someone walking outside our door.",
shame,"Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her  
grand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in  
mathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me  
and this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.   
When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be  
employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university   
there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they  
made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five  
days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another  
child to teach.",
shame,"I had taken the responsibility to do something and I had  
prepared for it.  However I failed because of my timidity.  After  
three attempts I still could not adapt to the atmosphere and  
failed as before.  I felt imcompetent and felt that the others  
would think that I had not prepared for it.",
fear,"I was at home and I heard a loud sound of spitting outside the  
door.  I thought that one of my family members would step on the spit  
and bring the germs in the house.",
guilt,"I did not do the homework that the teacher had asked us to do.  I  
was scolded immediately.",
fear,"I had shouted at my younger brother and he was always afraid when  
I called out loudly.",
